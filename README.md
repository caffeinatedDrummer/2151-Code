Hello! I am not sure what to say here but I will say that this is the code for the Monty Pythons, FRC 2151. 
Written in Java with Eclipse Kepler and Luna!

So far, here is everything the code does:

- Arcade drive at 60% power!

- A relay! 

- 4 Talon SR/SRXs!

- Really nooby programming!

- Gamepad controls! 

- A motor curve! 

- Limit Switches!

- Ultrasonic Range finding!

- Lots of outputs to SmartDashboard!

- Snarky comments!

- And more!

Controls (on an Xbox 360 controller (or alike)):
Left bumper = Close arms (set relay 0 to go reverse)
Right bumper = Open Arms (set relay 0 to go forwards)
Left stick = forwards/reverse 
Right stick = Turn left/right

Talon layout: 4 set with PWM 0 and 1 on the left, 2 and 3 on the right.
