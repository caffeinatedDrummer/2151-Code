Hello! I am not sure what to say here but I will say that this is the code for the Monty Pythons, FRC 2151. 
Written in Java with Eclipse Kepler and Luna!

So far, here is everything the code does:

-Drives with tank drive at 75% power!

-Two relays, controlled to go forwards and backwards while a button is held!

-Two sets of motor controllers!

-Really nooby programming!

-Gamepad controls!

-A motor curve! (Commented out because borked)

-Comments!

-And more!
